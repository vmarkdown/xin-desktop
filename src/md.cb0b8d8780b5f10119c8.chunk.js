It ends the code block and starts a new paragraph.\n\n\n## Fenced Code Blocks\n\nThe following code block uses syntax highlighting for Python:\n``` python\n@requires_authorization\ndef somefunc(param1=\'\', param2=0):\n    \'\'\'A docstring\'\'\'\n    if param1 > param2: # interesting\n        print \'Greater\'\n    return (param2 - param1 + 1) or None\nclass SomeClass:\n    pass\n>>> message = \'\'\'interpreter\n... prompt\'\'\'\n```\n\n## Lists\n\nThe following list **must** begin with the number 1:\n1. Only lists that start with 1 are allowed to interrupt paragraphs.\n1. Subsequent numbering is irrelevant.\n0. You can start a new line with any number as long as you use the same delimiter character.\n2) This item uses a different delimiter and starts a new ordered list, starting with the number 2.\n\nThis list can start with any number:\n\n4) The empty line means that the list does not interrupt a paragraph.\n1) The ordered list continues to increment the numbering from the previous list item.\n5) Use any number fewer than ten characters. This number is parsed as the third item in the ordered list.\n\n* Start unordered lists with -, *, or +.\n+ You don\'t even have to use the same character for each list item.\n- Pro tip: * and + require the Shift key. - doesn\'t. Format faster with the minus sign.\n  * Nest unordered list items with two spaces.\n    * Unordered lists support multiple levels of nesting.\n    \n    \n    \n## Checklists\n\nTODO:\n* [x] This item is marked as complete. The checkbox is checked.\n- [ ] This item is incomplete. The checkbox is unchecked.\n+ [ ] As with unordered lists, you can start the line with an asterisk, minus sign, or plus sign.\n    - [ ] Nest checklist items with two spaces.\n        -  [ ] Checklists support multiple levels of nesting.\n        \n        \n\n\n## Tables\n\n\nKitchen Cleanup Rotation\n\n| Month    | Assignee | Backup |\n| -------- | -------- | ------ |\n| January  | Dave     | Steve  |\n| February | Gregg    | Karen  |\n| March    | Diane    | Jorge  |\n\nHere\'s the same text with additional formatting and alternative syntax.\n+ The text in the first column is flush right.\n+ The text in the second column is centered.\n+ The Markdown is stripped down to the minimum syntax that is required to render the table.\n\nMonth | Assignee | Backup\n---:|:---:| ---\n**January** | Dave | _Steve_\n**February** | Gregg | _Karen_\n**March** | Diane | _Jorge_\n\n\n\n## Links\n\n[inline link](https://www.google.com)\n[inline link with tooltip](https://www.google.com "google")\n[reference link][1]\n\n[1]: https://www.google.com\n\n\n## Images\n\nHere\'s an image link to the logo:\n\n![logo](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "logo")\n\n\n## LaTeX\n\nThe editor converts LaTeX equations in double-dollars `$$`: $$ax^2+bx+c=0$$. All equations are rendered as block equations. If you need inline ones, you can add the prefix `\\inline`: $$\\inline p={1\\over q}$$. But it is a good practice to place big equations on separate lines:\n\n$$\nx_{1,2} = {-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \\over 2a}.\n$$\n\nIn this case the LaTeX syntax will be highlighted in the source code. You can even add equation numbers (unfortunately there is no automatic numbering and refs support):\n\n$$\n|\\vec{A}|=\\sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2}.\n$$(1)\n\n\n## flowchart\n\n```flow\nst=>start: Start\ne=>end\nop=>operation: My Operation\ncond=>condition: Yes or No?\n\nst->op->cond\ncond(yes)->e\ncond(no)->op\n```\n\n## sequence\n\n[Documentation for sequence](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/)\n\n\n```sequence\nAlice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?\nNote right of Bob: Bob thinks\nBob--\x3eAlice: I am good thanks!\n```\n\n```seq\nTitle: Here is a title\nA->B: Normal line\nB--\x3eC: Dashed line\nC->>D: Open arrow\nD--\x3e>A: Dashed open arrow\n```\n\n\n## G2\n\n[Documentation for G2](http://g2.alipay.com/)\n\n```g2\nconst data = [\n    { genre: \'Sports\', sold: 275 },\n    { genre: \'Strategy\', sold: 115 },\n    { genre: \'Action\', sold: 120 },\n    { genre: \'Shooter\', sold: 350 },\n    { genre: \'Other\', sold: 150 }\n];\n\nconst chart = new G2.Chart({\n    forceFit: true,\n    container: container,\n    height : 300\n});\nchart.source(data);\nchart.interval().position(\'genre*sold\').color(\'genre\')\nchart.render();\n\nreturn chart;\n```\n\n\n## Charts\n\n[Documentation for charts](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/)\n\n### Line Chart\n\n```chart\n{\n  "type": "line",\n  "data": {\n    "labels": [\n      "January",\n      "February",\n      "March",\n      "April",\n      "May",\n      "June",\n      "July"\n    ],\n    "datasets": [\n      {\n        "label": "# of bugs",\n        "fill": false,\n        "lineTension": 0.1,\n        "backgroundColor": "rgba(75,192,192,0.4)",\n        "borderColor": "rgba(75,192,192,1)",\n        "borderCapStyle": "butt",\n        "borderDash": [],\n        "borderDashOffset": 0,\n        "borderJoinStyle": "miter",\n        "pointBorderColor": "rgba(75,192,192,1)",\n        "pointBackgroundColor": "#fff",\n        "pointBorderWidth": 1,\n        "pointHoverRadius": 5,\n        "pointHoverBackgroundColor": "rgba(75,192,192,1)",\n        "pointHoverBorderColor": "rgba(220,220,220,1)",\n        "pointHoverBorderWidth": 2,\n        "pointRadius": 1,\n        "pointHitRadius": 10,\n        "data": [\n          65,\n          59,\n          80,\n          81,\n          56,\n          55,\n          40\n        ],\n        "spanGaps": false\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  "options": {}\n}\n```\n\n\n[Documentation for Line Chart](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#line-chart)\n\n### Bar Chart\n\n```chart\n{\n  "type": "bar",\n  "data": {\n  "labels": [\n    "Red",\n    "Blue",\n    "Yellow",\n    "Green",\n    "Purple",\n    "Orange"\n  ],\n  "datasets": [\n    {\n    "label": "# of Votes",\n    "data": [\n      12,\n      19,\n      3,\n      5,\n      2,\n      3\n    ],\n    "backgroundColor": [\n      "rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)",\n      "rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)",\n      "rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)",\n      "rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)",\n      "rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)",\n      "rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)"\n    ],\n    "borderColor": [\n      "rgba(255,99,132,1)",\n      "rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)",\n      "rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)",\n      "rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)",\n      "rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)",\n      "rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)"\n    ],\n    "borderWidth": 1\n    }\n  ]\n  },\n  "options": {}\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## mermaid\n\n[Documentation for mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/)\n\n```mermaid\n\ngraph TD\n    Start --\x3e Stop\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n\n```mermaid\n\ngraph LR\n    id1[This is the text in the box]\n\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```mermaid\n\ngraph LR\n    id1((This is the text in the circle))\n\n\n```\n\n\n-----\n\n```mermaid\n\ngraph TB\n    c1--\x3ea2\n    subgraph one\n    a1--\x3ea2\n    end\n    subgraph two\n    b1--\x3eb2\n    end\n    subgraph three\n    c1--\x3ec2\n    end\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n```mermaid\n\ngantt\n    title A Gantt Diagram\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n    section Section\n    A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d\n    Another task     :after a1  , 20d\n    section Another\n    Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d\n    another task      : 24d\n\n```\n\n\n'}}]);
